# LeetCode


A repository filled with Leetcode coding challenges. 

# How It's Made:

Tech used: JavaScript

# Optimisations

I consistently refactor and optimise my code, sometimes for efficiency, readability or to try an alternative way of solving a problem. The vast majoirty of my files contain multiple solutions showing various way to solve the kata.

# Lessons Learned:

+ The biggest lesson I learned in tackling Leetcode questions is understanding that there is a long way to go. Not being able to answer a question is fine, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
+ I also furthered my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
